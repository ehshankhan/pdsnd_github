### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
# BikeShare Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes data from bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It provides interactive data exploration capabilities, allowing users to filter and analyze bike usage patterns.

## Key Features
1. **City Selection**: Users can choose to analyze data from Chicago, New York City, or Washington.
2. **Time-based Filtering**: Data can be filtered by month and day of the week.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: The script calculates and displays various statistics, including:
   - Most frequent times of travel (month, day of week, hour)
   - Most popular stations and trips
   - Total and average trip durations


## Data Insights
The analysis provides insights into:
- Peak usage times for bike-sharing in each city
- Most popular starting and ending locations for bike trips
- Typical trip durations
- User type distribution (e.g., subscribers vs. casual users)
- Age and gender distribution of users (where available)

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: pandas for data manipulation, time for performance tracking
- **Data Source**: CSV files for each city (not included in the repository due to size)

## Usage
Users interact with the script via command-line prompts, selecting cities and filtering options. The script then processes the data and displays the results, with an option to view raw data in chunks.

## Purpose
This project serves as a tool for bike-sharing system operators, urban planners, and data enthusiasts to gain insights into bike usage patterns across different cities. It can help in decision-making for system improvements, resource allocation, and understanding user behavior in bike-sharing systems.
